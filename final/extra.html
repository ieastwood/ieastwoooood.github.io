<h1>Pencil Manufacturing</h1>
		
			<p>STEP 1: Chunks of graphite and clay are placed inside a huge rotating drum. Large rocks inside the drum crush the graphite and clay into a fine powder. Then water is added, and the mixture is blended in the drum for up to three days</p>
			<p>STEP 2: All the water is squeezed out of the mixture leaving behind a grey sludge. The sludge is then put into a cabinet where it air dries and hardens for four days.</p>
			<p>STEP 3: Wheels grind the dried sludge into fine powder, and water is blended in again to make a soft paste.</p>
			<p>STEP 4: The paste is pushed through a metal tube and comes out in the shape of thin rods. The rods are cut into pencil-length pieces, called leads, and sent along a conveyor belt to dry.</p>
			<p>STEP 5: The pencil leads are than put into an oven heated to 982.2222 degrees celsius.</p>
			<p>STEP 6: Cedar Wood is then into wide slats. Eight shallow grooves are sawed lengthwise into each slat.</p>
			<p>STEP 7: A thin coat of glue is applied to the slats, and one pencil lead is placed into each of the eight grooves.</p>
			<p>STEP 8: When the glue dries, the slats are fed through a cutting machine.</p>
			<p>STEP 9: The same machine cuts apart each slat into eight separate pencils.</p>
			<p>STEP 10: The pencils are sanded, and each one receives from five to eight coates of paint.</p>
			<p>STEP 11: A heated metal stamp presses the name of the company and a number - such as the number 2 - on the pencil in foil or paint. The number indicates how hard the pencil lead is.</p>
			<p>STEP 12: A metal band, called a ferrule, is wrapped tightly around one end of the pencil. The ferrule holds the eraser.</p>
